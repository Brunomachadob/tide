# Screens

## Onboarding

Shown on first launch when `~/.tide/settings.json` does not exist. Lets you pick which agents to configure. Generates a minimal no-auth profile for each selected agent and writes it to `~/.tide/settings.json`.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑` / `↓` / `j` / `k` | Move cursor |
| `Space` / `Enter` | Toggle selected agent |
| `c` | Confirm — write profiles and proceed to task list |
| `Esc` / `q` | Skip — proceed without selecting any agents |

## Task List (default)

The main screen. Shows all tasks with status, schedule, last result, and pending sync state.

### Workspace selector

The header subtitle shows the current workspace (`▾ <workspace-name>` or `▾ all workspaces`). Press `Tab` to cycle through all known workspaces and "all workspaces". The selector is hidden when only one workspace has tasks.

When multiple workspaces are visible ("all workspaces" mode), tasks are grouped by workspace with a section header between groups.

## Runs

Two-level screen for browsing a task's execution history and logs. Press `x` to open it from the task list or task detail.

### Runs list

Shows all runs newest-first. Each row displays start time, exit code badge, duration, and attempt count.

### Run detail

Shows metadata for the selected run (time, exit code, duration, attempts, and parent run ID for follow-ups) and its log output — scoped to that run only. Tide log lines are dimmed; markdown in Claude output is rendered.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Tab` | Switch between OUTPUT and STDERR tabs |

|-----|--------|
| `←` / `→` | Change value |
| `Enter` | Save settings |
| `Esc` / `q` | Back without saving |
| `j` / `k` | Scroll |
